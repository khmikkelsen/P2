//Is message signed or unsigned, and is sender/receiver public keys? is it the message encrypted before signing?
/* Signing message and public key encryption:
 * 1) hash message, fx sha256
 * 2) Encrypt digest with private key of sender; "Thus, an encrypted hash value is obtained". Use fx
 * a mathematical cryptographic encryption algorithm for calculating digital signatures from a message digest.(RSA)
 * 3) Verify:
 * 3.1) hash the SIGNED message; Use same hashing algorithm as before. " The obtained new hash is known as:
 * CURRENT HASH_VALUE"
 * 3.2) Decrypt the CURRENT HASH-VALUE with senders public key; Use same encryption algorithm as before.
 * "The result is known as: ORIGINAL HASH-VALUE, which is the hash value of message before signing(digest)"
 * 3.3) Compare CURRENT HASH_VALUE and ORIGINAL HASH_VALUE - must be identical.
